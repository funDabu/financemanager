### About

This project was originaly done as my individual work required for the completion of a c# university course, that I took.
I was my first Blazor app, and also my first experience with ASP.NET Core.

### Goal

The goal was to create simple application for personal finance management 
and my personal was also to get an initial experience Blazor app development.

### Result

Created application met the desired goals, but it is far from possible use in reality, 
mainly due to frontend issues and and some missing features.
